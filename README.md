# Introduction

A logics gate is an electronic circuit which makes logic decision. It accepts two state input and gives two state output only. The two state input-output '0' and '1', or 'low' and 'high' etc. A logic gate has only one output terminal and can have one or more than one input terminals. To get a right logical output, a logical input (i.e, either '0' or '1') is to be given to each input terminal. Hence, every input variable to a logic gate is either '0' or '1'.

There are different types of logic gates:
* OR gate
* AND gate
* NOT gate
* XOR gate
* NAND gate
* NOR gate

Among above gates, NAND & NOR gates are the most commonly encountered universal gate in logics gate. A universal gate is such a gate that we can implement any BOOLean function, no matter how complex, using a circuit that consists of only that particular gate. Using the universal gate we can make other logics gate such as OR gate, AND gate, NOT gate, XOR gate etc which are discussed below.
