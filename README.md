# Introduction

A logics gate is an electronic circuit which makes logic decision. It accepts two state input and gives two state output only. The two state input-output '0' and '1', or 'low' and 'high' etc. A logic gate has only one output terminal and can have one or more than one input terminals. To get a right logical output, a logical input (i.e, either '0' or '1') is to be given to each input terminal. Hence, every input variable to a logic gate is either '0' or '1'.

There are different types of logic gates:
* OR gate
* AND gate
* NOT gate
* XOR gate
